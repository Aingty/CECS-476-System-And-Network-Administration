Analysis section. 

1. Your machine has kernel panicked and crashed. 
Check log file associated with system
cat /var/log/syslog

2. Your machine has run out of diskspace on its root volume. 
Check disk usage  
df

3. You get a 403 Forbidden when trying to access a website you administer. 
Check config files associated with httpd
cat /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
In the Directory Listing for /, check that “Deny from all” is not one of the lines in it.
cat /etc/httpd/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
 
4. Your machine runs out of main memory and starts swapping to disk (very slow).
Check currently running processes
ps aux
Kill any unnecessary processes that is causing your machine to run out of main memory

5. All methods to remotely access your machine fail. You can still ping your machine though. 
Check permissions for ssh 
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Check to make sure that there is no “DenyUsers” in the config file

6. (Samba) You can mount a share on jaguar by its IP address but not its name. 
Check if DNS Proxy is enabled in Samba 
cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep dns  

7. Students get a 404 error when attempting to access their tilde directories via a web browser. 

404 error = browser communicated to server, but server could not find what was requested
Check user httpd configuration file
cat /etc/httpd/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
What to look for: 
<Directory “/home/~”> check for that entry and see if it exists 

8. (DNS) Your named does not start.
Check file permissions of DNS service /etc/rc.d/rc.bind 
ls -l /etc/rc.d/rc.bind

9. You ssh to a machine with public key authentication and get permission denied. 
Check if PubkeyAuthentication variable is set to yes in the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# prints out line that indicates if public key authentication is allowed
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep PubkeyAuthentication	
/etc.rc.d/rc.sshd restart	# only needed if config was modified

10. You are no longer seeing events in your log files even though you know there should be events. 
Check if /etc/rc.d/rc.syslog is running
/etc/rc.d/rc.syslog start		# will show message if service is running already

11. You get a 500 Server Error when trying to access a website you administer. 

500 error = something is wrong with the server, but the exact reason is unknown
Check server logs to see the reason 
tail -f  /var/log/httpd/error_log 
Or 
Check website permissions 
cat /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Ensure that the main home page “<Directory “/”> exists and that “Allow from all” is also there. The “/” can be the name of your main website.

12. You can ping your machine and other machines near you, but nothing else.
Check gateway and subnet for your machine. 
cat /etc/dhcpd.conf
Or 
Change default gateway so that machine can reach other machines
route add default gw ___.____.____.____
